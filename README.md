Evanescent
==========

What is it?
-----------
Evanescent is a lightweight jQuery plugin to create crossfading carousels.

What does it include?
---------------------
The bare minimum to use Evanescent is `scripts/evanescent.min.js` and `css/evanescent.css`. [jQuery](http://jquery.com) is required, of course.

`evanescent.js` is provided for tweaking, although the original source file is written in coffeescript and found in `src/evanescent.coffee`.

A demo page is provided at `demo/index.html` and can also be viewed live [here](http://ketsugi.com/evanescent/demo).

Downloading
-----------
The latest version of **Evanescent** should always be available on its [Github page](http://github.com/ketsugi/evanescent).

Installation and Usage
----------------------

Notes
-----
Evanescent owes a lot to [Unslider](http://unslider.com). I only wrote Evanescent because I needed a version of Unslider that did crossfades instead of sliding transitions, and I used Unslider's source code as a reference.
